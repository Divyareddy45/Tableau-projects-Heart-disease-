#Heart Disease Prediction project

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning and data visualization.

Overview
I used Python for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis(EDA) and model building, and Tableau for creating and interactive dashboard to  visualize key insights.


**Tools&Technologies**
-Python(pandas, numpy,matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)
-Tableau
-Jupyter Notebook

Visualization in Tableau

**Insights**

The Logistic Regression model achieved a strong accuracy of ~87%.

Balanced precision and recall indicate consistent performance for both outcomes.

Features such as age, cholesterol, and maximum heart rate showed strong influence on predictions.

Data Visualization Dashboard

To better understand the patterns behind cardiovascular disease, an interactive Tableau dashboard was created.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights:

Age vs Disease: Most heart disease cases occur between ages 40â€“60.

Gender-wise Comparison: Male patients show a higher rate of heart disease than females.

Cholesterol by Disease: Cholesterol levels are generally higher among diseased patients.

Heart Rate vs Age: Younger individuals tend to have higher maximum heart rates.

Overall Disease Distribution: ~54.5% of patients in the dataset were diagnosed with heart disease.
